Bravo for Power BI can connect to Power BI datasets, Analysis Services databases or just analyze VertiPaq Analyzer files (VPAX).

If you run Bravo from the External Tools ribbon of Power BI Desktop, you are already connected. Otherwise, you can connect in three different ways: 

- **Attach to Power BI Desktop**: You can open or attach Bravo to an already opened Power BI report file.

- **Connect to Power BI Service:** You can connect Bravo to a dataset published on Power BI Service.

- **Open a VPAX file**: You can open a Vertipaq Analyzer file previously created by Bravo, Dax Studio, or Tabular Editor. 
> Note that VPAX files contain statistical information about a Tabular model without any data.
