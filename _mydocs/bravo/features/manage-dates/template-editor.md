The template editor provides the following features:

- **Generates the template package** from the template workspace every time a file is saved in the *src* folder.
- **Shows a preview of the template result** by using Bravo connected to an instance of Power BI Desktop with a model compatible with the template.

1. Only the files in the *src* folder should be modified in Visual Studio Code.
2. Opens the Bravo Template Editor pane.

The Bravo Template Editor pane creates the connection to a Power BI Desktop model used to validate the template and generate a preview of the template result.
The preview is updated every time a file is saved in the *src* folder.

1. Chooses an existing Power BI Desktop connection. *Browse* opens a PBIX file with Power BI Desktop, waiting for the proper initialization and the connecting to that model automatically.
2. Shows the preview of the DAX code generated for a table or a measure selected in the *Model Changes Preview* pane.
3. Opens a Preview Data window showing the content preview of a table generated by the template and selected in the *Model Changes Preview* pane.
4. Shows tables and measures created by the template. By clicking an object, the corresponding preview windows are automatically updated, unless they are pinned in Visual Studio Code, in which case a new window is created when a different object is selected.
5. Shows a preview of the table content generated by the template.
