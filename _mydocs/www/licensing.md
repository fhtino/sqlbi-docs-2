At SQLBI, we provide comprehensive licensing options for our video courses and subscriptions, ensuring flexibility and convenience for both individual learners and organizations. Our licenses are designed to cater to different needs, making it easier for license managers to allocate, manage, and optimize access to our premium content.

A license is to be considered a personal authorization to consume premium content, has a duration, and must be assigned to a user, even temporarily, in order to be used. Licenses are either transferable or untransferable.

## Untransferable Licenses
Untransferable licenses are licenses that can only be assigned to one person at all. You do not have to assign them to a user at the time of purchase. This is something you can do from your dashboard later on, as the license manager. This is useful if you aren't sure who needs the license just yet at the time of purchase, or if you're mixing and matching differnet amounts of different courses.

One great, new feature of our untransferable licenses is that you can delegate the assignment of the licenses to the users themselves by creating an auto-enrollment link that you send out. That can represent a significant time saving for you as the license manager, if you purchase a large number of licenses and don't want to be entering everyone's details yourself.


## Transferable Licenses
Transferable licenses are licenses that can be passed from user to user as many times as you want, throughout the license's entire lifespan. Only one user can use a license at any given time.

One feature we have made available, is the ability for the license manager to create and entirely customize a library for the users. **Users can *borrow* and *return* transferable licenses, an unlimited amount of times.** This can greatly reduce your cost of training â€“ keep your transferable license working hard!

As you customize the library, you fully control whom the licenses are assigned to, when a license is revoked and re-assigned, you can follow your students' progress (in case of video courses), you can set the duration of availability of a license, you can even enable users to enroll themselves to keep the license moving forward around your team.

## License Manager

The License Manager is a web interface that allows you to manage your licenses, students, and courses. It is the central hub for all your licensing needs, providing you with the tools to assign, revoke, and monitor licenses, as well as track student progress and manage course enrollments.
