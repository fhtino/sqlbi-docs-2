There are several examples of date templates implementing common calendars that are also used by [Bravo for Power BI](https://bravo.bi). Each of these templates is a base for corresponding [time intelligence patterns](https://www.daxpatterns.com/time-patterns/). 

- **[Standard](./standard-calendar.md)**: regular Gregorian calendar that can be used with the [Standard time-related calculations](https://www.daxpatterns.com/standard-time-related-calculations/).
- **[Monthly](./monthly-calendar.md)**: Gregorian calendar for monthly-based reports. It can be used with the [Month-related calculations](https://www.daxpatterns.com/month-related-calculations/).
- **[Weekly](./weekly-calendar.md)**: Weekly calendar for ISO 8601 or other week-based calendars (like 4-4-5) with 52 or 53 weeks in each year. It can be used with the [Week-related calculations](https://www.daxpatterns.com/week-related-calculations/).
- **[Custom](./custom-calendar.md)**: Gregorian calendar that supports [Custom time-related calculations](https://www.daxpatterns.com/custom-time-related-calculations/) based on DAX code that can support non-standard calculations and it does not use the standard DAX time-intelligence functions.

Each of these date templates has specific parameters that can be customized in the DAX code global variables at the beginning of the calculated table definition generated by the template. The default for these global variables can be also set in the [DefaultVariables](./../configuration/config-object/custom-table.md#defaultvariables) setting of the template configuration.
