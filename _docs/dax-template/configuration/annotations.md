The Dax Template library uses annotations to identify dependencies for Measure Templates and to mark columns, tables, and measures generated by the library.
The predefined classes in Dax Template use annotations with the **SQLBI_** prefix. However, the library can be used with different configurations, using other naming conventions for the annotations.

## SQLBI Annotations
