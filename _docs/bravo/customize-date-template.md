The [Templates](options.md#templates) page can add, delete, and modify user date templates for Bravo.

## Template workspace and package

A **template workspace** is an entire folder hierarchy identified by a file with the extension *.code-workspace*.

A **template package** is a single JSON file that contains a user template (extension *.package.json*). In terms of consumption, for a Bravo user a template is a template package. In order to customize a template, it is necessary to create a template workspace. A template package is obtained by combining the content of several JSON files included in a template workspace.

Bravo creates a new template by copying all the original template files of one of the predefined templates. In order to modify an organization or user template, the corresponding template workspace must be provided by the template author. The template package cannot generate a corresiponding template workspace.

The JSON files included in the template workapce can be editing using any text editor. However, Bravo is integrated with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [Bravo Template Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SQLBI.bravo-template-editor) extension. 

In order to edit a template, Bravo opens the template workspace in Visual Studio Code. The workspace includes several files, but only two folders are relevant to customize a Date template:
- The **src** folder contains the source files of the Date template. The content of these files is described in the [Dax Template](https://docs.sqlbi.com/dax-template/) documentation.

- The **dist** folder contains a single template package file. This is the Date template file that can be provided to a Bravo user in order to consume the template.

The entire template workspace folder must be copied in order to edit a template on a different computer. When Bravo opens a template package, if the file is in the *dist* folder of a template workspace, then Bravo shows the button to edit the template.

## Bravo Template Editor

The Bravo Template Editor provides the following features:
- **Generates the template package** from the template workspace every time a file is saved in the *src* folder.
- **Shows a preview of the template result** by using Bravo connected to an instance of Power BI Desktop with a model compatible with the template.

1. Only the files in the *src* folder should be modified in Visual Studio Code.
2. Opens the Bravo Template Editor pane.

The Bravo Template Editor pane creates the connection to a Power BI Desktop model used to validate the template and generate a preview of the template result.
The preview is updated every time a file is saved in the *src* folder.

1. Chooses an existing Power BI Desktop connection. *Browse* opens a PBIX file with Power BI Desktop, waiting for the proper initialization and the connecting to that model automatically.
2. Shows the preview of the DAX code generated for a table or a measure selected in the *Model Changes Preview* pane.
3. Opens a Preview Data window showing the content preview of a table generated by the template and selected in the *Model Changes Preview* pane.
4. Shows tables and measures created by the template. By clicking an object, the corresponding preview windows are automatically updated, unless they are pinned in Visual Studio Code, in which case a new window is created when a different object is selected.
5. Shows a preview of the table content generated by the template.
